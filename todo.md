- test set up and tear down are stubbs - either add something meaning full to them or remove them from the process
  - pull out prisma mocks from tests into seperate structure
- have package to be able to debug while running and with tests
- setup integration and e2e tests
- have package working in a dockerfile
- check against archetectural patterns like clean archetecture
- understand more about dependancy injection
- confirm test coverage
- ensure READMEs and documentation are actually up to date with recent changes
- run prisma migrations `prisma migrate dev`
- update api specifications to use openAPI and surface docs on an endpoint
- Error handling and validation
    - Use class-validator and class-transformer (already dependencies) effectively within your DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in NestJS to validate incoming request bodies and query parameters.
    - Implement consistent error handling. NestJS filters can help centralize error logging and formatting responses (as hinted in app-spec.md).
- fix up environment varables and add `.example.env`
