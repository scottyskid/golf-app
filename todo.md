- setup integration and e2e tests
- check against archetectural patterns like clean archetecture
- understand more about dependancy injection and look to include it in the api potentially
- confirm test coverage
- Error handling and validation
    - Use class-validator and class-transformer (already dependencies) effectively within your DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in NestJS to validate incoming request bodies and query parameters.
    - Implement consistent error handling. NestJS filters can help centralize error logging and formatting responses (as hinted in app-spec.md).
- add proper logging module with an otel sink
    - get otel feeding metrics and traces fully into the aspire dashboard
    - consolidate where otel params are being set, because currently they are done in `otel.config.ts`, `otel.module.ts`, `main.ts` and `docker-compose.yml`
    - move otel to gRPC from HTTP
- clean up endpoints (where should health be? where should version be?)
    - see if nestjs has built in health checks
- add a central service for database connection/auth
    - can we do this for both testing and production?
- is it possible to get hot reloading in the container?
